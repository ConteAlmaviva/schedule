This is a simple addon to display next arrival and departure times for ferries and airships, similar to the MithraPride and Pyogenes FFXI timers. (It does not include RSE or crafting shop holidays as of yet.)

Place the `schedule.lua` and `date.lua` files in a folder called `schedule` in your `Ashita\addons` directory. Load the addon with `/addon load schedule` in-game. By default, the schedule window is hidden; visibility can be toggled off and on with `/schedule` or `/sched`.
